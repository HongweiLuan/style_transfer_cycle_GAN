========================
Style Transfer CycledGAN
========================

The CycleGAN is a technique that involves the automatic training of image-to-image translation models without paired examples. The models are trained in an unsupervised manner using a collection of images from the source and target domain that do not need to be related in any way.

In this project, we are going to generate handbags from sketched outlines without using
explicit pair matching using DiscoGAN.
